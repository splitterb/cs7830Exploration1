                <p>Okay so this is actually really cool. Vue allows us to create what's essentially user-defined html tags that can have pretty much any set of different specifications we want. That means if you're going to be re-using a lot of code, you can just create your own component and save a lot of time / make sure it's consistent. We're also able to feed in different pieces of data from new Vue instances that we create (think: the Vue instance is the parent, and the component we create is the child). For this example, I've simply hard-coded in some information inside of the instance - but what someone <i>could</i> do is take in a set of JSON data from an API and then display that information reactively as the information changed from the API!!!</p>
